# CS365 Shell Project
This project was to create a "shell" that can take 16 piped command inputs in C.

# To Run
1. In a linux environment, open a terminal in this folder.
2. Type ```./shell``` and the program will now be running
3. Input commands and press enter to see their outputs. An example of a command it should be able to run is the following input: ```ls -l -a | nl | nl | nl | nl | nl```

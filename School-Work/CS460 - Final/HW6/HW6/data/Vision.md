# Vision Statement

At "Doughnut Dreams & Brewed Beans," our vision is to revolutionize the coffee shop experience. We seek to establish a place that transcends the boundaries of traditional coffee houses and becomes a modern, welcoming, and stylish haven for individuals from all walks of life. We envision a space that people yearn to visit at any time of day, whether to kickstart their morning, enjoy a leisurely afternoon, or unwind in the evening.

Our establishment will exude a sense of calm and sophistication, achieved through soft colors, comfortable furniture, and captivating artwork that adorns our walls. We aim to create an oasis where visitors can escape the stresses of their daily lives, fostering an environment that promotes relaxation and genuine human connection.

However, we understand that a serene atmosphere alone is not enough in the fast-paced, technology-driven world we live in. To address this, we are committed to pushing the envelope in terms of coffee shop technology. We will develop an advanced online and mobile ordering and fulfillment system, ensuring that our patrons can place their orders with ease, reducing wait times and enhancing overall efficiency.

One of our primary objectives is to eliminate the frustratingly long lines and wait times that have become synonymous with many coffee chains. To accomplish this, we've reimagined the traditional service model. Our coffee shop features dedicated workstations where specialized employees focus on crafting specific items within an order. This means that every latte, donut, or fruit salad is made with precision and care by a dedicated expert, ensuring quality and expediency in service.

Our vision for "Doughnut Dreams & Brewed Beans" is to seamlessly combine the best of both worlds - a serene and stress-free ambiance with cutting-edge technology and efficiency. We are dedicated to redefining the coffee shop experience by offering exceptional coffee, delectable treats, and efficient service, all within a space that exudes modernity and comfort. We invite you to join us on this journey to transform the way people enjoy their daily coffee and culinary delights.

## Elements of our plan

1. We aim to be known for fresh donuts and great coffee
2. But we'll excel at other coffee shop foods as well
3. Our distinction is to have employees trained on specific stations that focus on fulfilling just one category of product.  Each station produces one class of product so it can be heavily optimized.  Employees don't have to multi-task and can put extra effort into making each item perfect.  
4. Critical to this plan is the technology to allow orders to be received, items from that order to be sent directly to each appropriate station, and only that station, where the employee can produce that item and check it off as it is delivered to the delivery area to be combined with all their other items.  The order is complete when every item in it has been fulfilled.

    For example, a customer has ordered an Americano, a Lemon Poppy Seed Cake, and two Nutella-Filled Donuts.  In a traditional coffee shop, the attendant would take the order, select a cup and write Americano on it for the barista to fulfill, then go to the cake/cookie area to select the cake, then trip over their fellow employee while going to the donut station to grab the donuts, and finally put them all together into one order (while waiting for the barista to finish) to set on the delivery counter.  This is a hectic mostly linear process that wears on attendants.  

    Our system leverages an advanced technology pipeline to optimize this system.  Orders come in through our online/mobile system directly to each station.  The espresso station has a screen displaying all items it needs to produce.  The pastry station has a screen displaying all the items it needs to produce.  The donut station has a screen showing all the items it needs to produce.  As the order comes in, it is split up so each item goes to its respective station.  Individual specialized attendants/chefs/baristas/servers at each station simply produce whatever comes up top on their screen, checks it off as complete and sends it to the appropriate delivery fulfillment area where it is combined into the whole order and delivered to the customer (who received a notification on their mobile device automatically as soon as the last item in their order was checked off).  This non-linear, tree-like production system can be highly optimized to drastically shorten the time from order to delivery while simultaneously increasing the quality of the products produced and increasing happiness of employees.
